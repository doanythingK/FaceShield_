# Ownership / Workspace Hardening Status

## Current direction

Branch: `refactor/ownership-workspace-hardening`

The active hardening priority is user-visible correctness, resource/lifetime safety, persistence ordering, and responsibility/policy boundaries. Filesystem path edge cases should not consume additional implementation time unless a reproduced failure makes them relevant again.

## PATH identity hardening

Status: **DEFERRED / 보류**

### Core work completed

- [x] Separate filesystem access path from workspace identity key.
- [x] Use filesystem case policy for the current v4 identity.
- [x] Keep case-only rename and stale-save/removal identity consistent under normal case-insensitive filesystem conditions.
- [x] Preserve v3/v2/pre-identity/legacy workspace lookup compatibility.
- [x] Move filesystem identity calculation outside `GlobalStateGate`.
- [x] Reuse operation-scoped path identity in workspace save/remove and Home recent/cache matching.

### Deferred residual work

- [ ] **DEFERRED:** avoid synchronous filesystem/native case-policy queries on latency-sensitive caller/UI paths. Slow network or external storage can still delay `CreatePathContext()`.
- [ ] **DEFERRED:** add a recovery policy for v4 state when filesystem case policy changes after save or native case-policy lookup falls back/fails. The current v4 match is intentionally strict and can fail before payload lookup in this condition.
- [ ] **DEFERRED:** decide whether symlink/junction aliases should resolve to one physical workspace identity. Current policy keeps alias paths distinct.
- [ ] **DEFERRED:** define/test behavior for exotic Unicode case-folding and normalization semantics across supported filesystems.

Resume this block only when higher-priority hardening work is complete or a real reproduced workspace-path failure requires it.

## Existing architectural deferrals

These are documented limitations rather than the next active implementation block.

- [ ] **DEFERRED:** cancel an already-running synchronous FaceONNX `FaceDetector.Forward()` call. The current detector interface does not expose a safe mid-inference cancellation contract; pre/post-call cooperative cancellation remains in place.
- [ ] **DEFERRED:** replace the global 1,000,000 decoded-PTS resident-frame limit with paging/persistent indexing. This requires a different cache architecture rather than another cap adjustment.

## Next active block

Status: **IN PROGRESS**

Resume the historical ownership/workspace hardening sequence by continuing responsibility/policy extraction from `WorkspaceViewModel` and its coordinators. The next concrete target is export quality-gate diagnostics: export result risk calculation/logging belongs with export diagnostics rather than in the page ViewModel and should not be injected back into `WorkspaceExportCoordinator` as a ViewModel callback.
